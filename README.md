# ReactJS - First test app

See [DEMO](https://kevintss.github.io/reactjs--frist-test-app/)

This app is a test to play with reactjs, I started it to test the technology and have a sandbox to play with.
After few time, I decided to continue working on it to add other test that I want to try.
So at the end, this app will gather all test and lib that I want to try or test.
